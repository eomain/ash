ash: acorn shell (2018)

ash is a command shell interpreter. Commands can either be read directly from
the user at the command prompt or from a given file, upon which they are evaluated
and executed. You can use ash to write/run shell scripts with the following properties.
Set and unset both atomic and composite (tuple) variables, evaluate expressions and use
some common programming language constructs, such as if-else statements,
loops (for and while) and functions.

Please note that as of now ash does not have a stable release and some
features that may be missing are still in development.


Project directories:

    ash:        source directory
    doc:        documentation
    include:    header files
    lib:        library
    share:      misc
    tests:      ash test scripts


Install:

    To install ash we can use the ash script 'install'.
    If ash is not already installed then we first need to build ash
    from source. The install script will by default install ash to
    '/usr/local/bin' and the man page to '/usr/local/man/man1'. These
    variables can be changed, but be careful if running as root.

    To build ash. Type from the root directory:
        `make ash`

    To do the installation we must run ash as root:
        `sudo ./bin/ash`

    Once ash has started, run the install script:
        `source install`

    Exit from root session:
        `exit`

    Start new ash session:
        `ash`

    View the ash man page:
        `man ash`


Basic usage:

    # to display prompt
        help

    # to list builtin commands
        builtin

    # to change directory
        cd <directory>

    # set a variable
        var := "acorn"

    # to print variable:
        echo $var

    # to evaluate an expression
        [ 2 + 2 ]  # 4

    # if statement
        if [ true ]
            read -p "enter name: " name
            echo "welcome" $name
        end

    # for loop
        for i in [ 0 to 10 ]
            echo $ASH
        end

    # function
        main:
            echo $1
        end

        main("this is a function")

    # load/import a script into the current shell
        source <script>

    # execute a script (needs ash to be installed on the path
    # and must have execute permission)
        ./script
